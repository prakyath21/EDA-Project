## üìë Overview
This project involves Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset to derive meaningful insights and visualize key trends and patterns.
EDA helps to understand the structure, clean the data, and make it analysis-ready. The code is contained within a Jupyter Notebook for easy exploration and reproducibility.

## üöÄ Project Workflow
üöÄ Project Workflow
This project follows a systematic EDA process:

1. Data Collection & Loading
Load datasets using pandas.
Preview structure using .head(), .info(), and .describe() methods.
2. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
Handling Missing Values:
Impute missing values with mean, median, or mode.
Drop rows/columns if necessary.
Outlier Detection and Treatment:
Using box plots and IQR methods.
Data Type Conversion:
Ensure correct data types for columns.
3. Handling Categorical Data
Label Encoding / One-Hot Encoding for categorical variables.
Handle high-cardinality categorical features effectively.
4. Univariate Analysis
Use histograms and boxplots to explore individual variables.
Analyze the distribution of numerical features (e.g., skewness, kurtosis).
5. Bivariate and Multivariate Analysis
Correlation Analysis:
Generate heatmaps to understand correlations between variables.
Scatter Plots:
Visualize relationships between numerical variables.
Categorical vs. Numerical Analysis:
Use bar plots and violin plots.
6. Feature Engineering
Create new features based on domain knowledge.
Perform scaling and normalization for numerical features.
Use feature selection techniques to keep the most relevant columns.
7. Statistical Tests & Hypothesis Testing
Apply ANOVA or t-tests to validate relationships between variables.
Use Chi-square tests for categorical data associations.
Check for normality and homoscedasticity.
8. Data Visualization
Pairplots: Explore relationships between all variables at once.
Heatmaps: Visualize correlations.
Custom visualizations for more intuitive insights (e.g., donut charts, word clouds).
