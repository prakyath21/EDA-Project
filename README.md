## 📑 Overview
This project involves Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset to derive meaningful insights and visualize key trends and patterns.
EDA helps to understand the structure, clean the data, and make it analysis-ready. The code is contained within a Jupyter Notebook for easy exploration and reproducibility.

## 🚀 Project Workflow
The EDA is broken into the following steps:

Data Loading: Importing the necessary libraries and loading the dataset.
Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, correcting data types, and dealing with outliers.
Univariate Analysis: Exploring individual columns using histograms and boxplots.
Bivariate Analysis: Analyzing relationships between pairs of variables (e.g., correlation heatmaps, scatter plots).
Data Visualization: Using tools like matplotlib and seaborn for plots.
Key Findings and Insights: Highlighting meaningful trends observed in the dataset.
